  - **Left Edge**: Creates a vertical split with the new window on the left
  - **Right Edge**: Creates a vertical split with the new window on the right  
  - **Top Edge**: Creates a horizontal split with the new window on top
  - **Bottom Edge**: Creates a horizontal split with the new window on bottom
  - **Center Area**: Adds the window to the existing stack

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Tree Structure
Each macOS Space maintains an independent BSP tree with:

| Component | Description | Properties |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Root Node** | Contains all windows in the space with full screen dimensions | `position`, `size`, `leaf`, `windows` |
| **Internal Nodes** | Split the space horizontally or vertically with configurable ratios | `split_type`, `split_ratio`, `child1`, `child2` |
| **Leaf Nodes** | Contain actual windows, supporting multiple windows per leaf (stacking) | `windows[]`, `leaf = true` |
| **Selected Node** | Currently active leaf node for operations | Tracks current focus state |
| **Focused Window** | The window that receives focus when switching spaces | Frontmost window in selected node |

#### Event System
The window manager subscribes to multiple Hammerspoon events:

| Event Type | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Window Creation** | New window appears | Automatically adds manageable windows to current space |
| **Window Focus** | Window gains focus | Updates selected node and maintains focus tracking |
| **Window Movement** | Window is dragged or moved | Handles drag-and-drop operations and space transitions |
| **Window Destruction** | Window is closed | Removes windows and collapses empty nodes |
| **Space Changes** | User switches spaces | Switches between space trees and refreshes layouts |
| **Window Maximization** | Window goes full-screen | Clears focus tracking for full-screen windows |
| **Window Minimization** | Window is minimized | Removes from management temporarily |
| **Window Restoration** | Window is unminimized | Adds back to management |

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Only the current space is actively managed
- **Event Throttling**: Window move events are throttled to prevent excessive processing
- **Position Tracking**: Tracks window positions to distinguish user vs system moves
- **Efficient Lookups**: Uses window ID-based comparisons for robust window tracking
- **Re-entrancy Protection**: Prevents recursive calls during layout operations

### Algorithm Details

2. **Edge Detection**: Determine which edge of a window the mouse is closest to
3. **Split Decision**: Create horizontal or vertical splits based on edge proximity
4. **Stack Management**: Add to existing stack if mouse is in center area
5. **Tree Update**: Rebuild tree structure and apply new layout

#### Resize Algorithm
For dynamic window resizing:

1. **Parent Detection**: Find the appropriate split parent in the tree hierarchy
2. **Ratio Calculation**: Update split ratios based on window position changes
3. **Continuous Updates**: Apply changes in real-time during resize operations
4. **Boundary Enforcement**: Maintain valid split ratios between 0.0 and 1.0

#### Space Management Algorithm
For multi-space support:

1. **Space Detection**: Identify the current space using macOS APIs
2. **Tree Selection**: Switch to the appropriate tree for the current space
3. **Window Migration**: Handle windows moving between spaces
4. **Focus Preservation**: Maintain focus state across space transitions

#### Layout Persistence Algorithm
For saving and restoring window arrangements:

1. **Window Identification**: Store window titles, app names, and indices for reconstruction
2. **Tree Serialization**: Convert BSP tree structure to JSON format
3. **Lazy Reconstruction**: Rebuild trees only when spaces become active
4. **Fallback Matching**: Use multiple strategies to match saved windows to current windows
